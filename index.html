    <p> <u>Web development</u> is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
        intranet (a private network).<b>[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of
            plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
            comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
            design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network
            security configuration, and e-commerce development.
            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of <a
                href=//www.google.com/ target="_parent">building</a> Web sites: writing markup and coding.<b>[2] Web
                development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with
                basic technical skills.

            style="color:rgba(206, 13, 13, 0.671)">Web dovelopment</spans> teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
            developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller
            organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
            related job positions such as a graphic designer or  information systems technician. Web development may be a
            collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three
            kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3]
            Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end
            developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has
            become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>
